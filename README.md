# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict survival on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## What I Did
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data
- Explored relationships between features
- Built models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression
- Evaluated model accuracy and performance

## How to Run
- The notebook file `titanic_survival.ipynb` contains all the steps and code
- Use Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment to run it

## Dataset
The dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

## Results
The best model achieved about 80% accuracy in predicting survival.
